### Communication and Office Hours
For questions about the lectures or tutorials you *can either send me an email or join the Slack channel* I have set up for the course. Slack is a workspace hub with amazing chat features that allow for a quick and efficient communication. The idea behind this is to create a virtual space where you can ask questions that me and your colleague will be able to see as well (use emails for private communication!). For a fancier description on slack click [HERE](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-).

In general, I scheduled my office hours on **Tuesdays from 15 to 16 (*ONLY* upon request)**. While I am certainly happy to meet students, I would encourage you to bring up doubts, questions or issues of sort during tutorials.
